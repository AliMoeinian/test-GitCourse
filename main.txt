Hello this is a test to change my main file in nano.
im learning git and its really exciting for me.
hope you enjoy it.
This is a new change on my file to check how git diff works.
I enter this last line to check how diff works again.
i add this line to learn more about git commands and i really like git.
i add this line to use git commit --amend and lets see what going to happen
i add this line after i make the error correct and now lets test.
